# Valet — guide for Claude Code

This file is loaded automatically when this repo is opened in Claude Code. If a user
asks you to help them set up or use Valet, follow this guide. Your role is twofold:
**help them install and connect Valet**, and — once it's running — **place the trades
they ask for**. The trading *decision* (what/when) is always the user's; Valet is just
the reliable execution plumbing.

Valet is an MCP server that trades on **Interactive Brokers**, including **fractional
shares by dollar amount**. See `README.md` for the full picture and `DECISIONS.md` for
the reasoning behind the design.

## Helping a user set it up

Walk the user through the steps below. Run the commands you can; clearly hand off the
ones only they can do (anything on the IBKR side — you cannot log in for them).

### 1. Install (you can do this)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows (PowerShell): & ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
# Linux/macOS:          source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure `.env` (you can do this — ask the user for their values)

Set at least `IBKR_ACCOUNT_ID`. Keep the safe defaults: `IBKR_TRADING_MODE=paper`,
`TRADING_ALLOW_LIVE=false`, `TRADING_DRY_RUN=true`. Never commit `.env`.

### 3. The IBKR side (ONLY the user can do this — guide them clearly)

- An **IBKR Pro** account, open and funded (required by the API, even for paper).
- **Fractional permission**: Client Portal → Settings → Trading → Trading Permissions →
  Stocks → check **"Global (Trade in Fractions)"**.
- A **dedicated username** for the bot (IBKR allows one brokerage session per username;
  logging into TWS/mobile with the same user kills the gateway session).
- **Download and start the Client Portal Gateway** (Java app), then **log in via the
  browser** at `https://localhost:5000` with 2FA. This manual login is unavoidable —
  IBKR has no OAuth for retail. See the "Gateway setup" and "Login troubleshooting"
  sections of the README.

### 4. Register the MCP server with Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add ibkr -- /path/to/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ibkr_agent.server.app
```

The tools appear in a **new** Claude Code session.

### 5. Verify

```bash
python -m ibkr_agent.healthcheck   # or: ibkr-healthcheck
```

A healthy result shows `authenticated=True connected=True`, the account flags
(`supportsCashQty`/`supportsFractions`), the balance, and a quote.

## Known issues

### Login goes through but nothing happens

**Symptom:** the user opens `https://localhost:5000`, logs in, approves 2FA, the page
loads — but then nothing happens. It just sits there and never reaches a logged-in
state, and the healthcheck keeps reporting `authenticated=False` / `connected=False`
(sometimes with `ssodh/init` returning HTTP 500 or a `no bridge` error).

**What fixes it:** restart the gateway cleanly and log in fresh. Stop the gateway's Java
process, start it again (`bin\run.bat root\conf.yaml` on Windows, `bin/run.sh
root/conf.yaml` on Linux/macOS), then reload `https://localhost:5000` and log in again.
A clean restart clears this in the large majority of cases — guide the user through it
first. Logging in from an incognito/private browser tab also helps (stale cookies can
get in the way).

**If it still persists:** it can also help to log out of any other IBKR session — IBKR
allows only one brokerage session per username, so a session open in IBKR Mobile or the
Client Portal web can block the gateway. Have the user log those out, restart the
gateway once more, and try again.

**Important — the login is not sticky.** Every time a fresh login is needed (the session
expired, the machine slept, the daily maintenance window passed), do the clean restart
*first*; don't just retry the login against the gateway that's already running. The
sequence is always: restart the gateway → then log in.

## Using Valet day to day

These are **all 19 MCP tools** you have once the `ibkr` server is connected — your full
capability surface. Every tool returns an `{"ok": bool, "data"/"error": ...}` envelope.

**Session & market**
- `session_status` — is the gateway authenticated/connected/competing, **and which
  account is live**: it returns `account_type` (`"LIVE"`/`"PAPER"`) from IBKR's
  `isPaper` (a LIVE account also returns a `warning`). This is the ground truth — the
  `IBKR_TRADING_MODE` label can disagree. Check it before trading so you never mistake
  a real-money account for paper. `portfolio` carries the same `account_type`.
- `market_status` — is the US market open (RTH) right now.

**Quotes & account (read-only)**
- `get_quote(symbol)` — last/bid/ask for one symbol.
- `get_quotes(symbols)` — quote a whole watchlist in **one** call (cheaper than N `get_quote`).
- `account_summary` — available funds, net liquidation, buying power.
- `positions` — open positions.
- `portfolio` — account summary + positions + total unrealized P&L in one snapshot.

**Before committing**
- `preview_order(symbol, side, cash_amount|quantity, limit_price?)` — IBKR `whatif`:
  estimated commission, cost, available-funds impact and warnings **without sending**.

**Placing orders**
- `buy(symbol, cash_amount|quantity, limit_price?)` — market by default; `cash_amount`
  is fractional via cashQty; pass `limit_price` for a LIMIT (needs `quantity`).
- `sell(symbol, quantity, limit_price?)` — by shares (IBKR forbids selling by dollar amount).
- `close_position(symbol)` — exits 100% of a position at the exact fractional quantity.
- `stop_order(symbol, side, quantity, stop_price, limit_price?)` — a STOP (stop-loss),
  or STOP-LIMIT if `limit_price` is given.
- `trailing_stop(symbol, side, quantity, trail_amount|trail_percent)` — a stop that
  follows the price (locks in gains as it moves).
- `bracket_order(symbol, quantity, take_profit, stop_loss, side?, entry_limit_price?)` —
  an entry with attached take-profit + stop-loss exits (OCO: one fills, the other cancels).

**After placing**
- `order_status(order_id)` — state, filled quantity, average price (use it to confirm a
  fill; `positions` lags right after a trade).
- `wait_for_fill(order_id, timeout_seconds?)` — poll until it fills (or is cancelled/
  rejected), so you don't orchestrate the retry yourself (timeout capped at 120s).
- `open_orders` — active orders. `cancel_order(order_id)` — cancel one.
- `trade_history(limit?)` — local audit log of every attempt (sent, dry-run, blocked).

**Order types supported:** market, limit, stop, stop-limit, trailing-stop, and brackets —
plus fractional **buys by dollar amount** (cashQty) and fractional sells by quantity.

**Session upkeep:** the MCP server keeps its own session warm (background `/tickle`). For
headless/scheduled use there's also `python -m ibkr_agent.keepalive` (`ibkr-keepalive`),
which alerts (`[ALERT] Reauthentication required: ...`) when the user must log in again.

## Safety — read before placing any order

Valet ships safe by default and you must keep it that way:

- **Never** set `TRADING_ALLOW_LIVE=true` or `TRADING_DRY_RUN=false` on your own. Only
  do it if the user explicitly asks, understands it means **real money**, and confirms.
- Orders are blocked outside regular trading hours, above `MAX_ORDER_VALUE`, and when an
  unknown confirmation warning appears.
- Before a real order, confirm the symbol, side, and amount back to the user.
- **Never assume paper vs. live from the config or defaults.** Call `session_status`
  and read `account_type` — if it's `LIVE`, you are moving real money; say so plainly
  to the user. Paper account ids start with `DU`, live ones with `U`.

## Contributing to Valet itself

If the task is changing Valet's code (not just using it): keep the hexagonal structure
(domain ports, CPAPI adapters, safety guards, MCP server), add tests for new logic
(the suite runs offline), and make sure `ruff check .` and `pytest -q` pass — CI runs
both. Commits follow Conventional Commits. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
