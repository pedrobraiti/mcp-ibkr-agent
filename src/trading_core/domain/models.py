"""Domain models — agnostic to the concrete broker.

Monetary values use ``Decimal`` to avoid floating-point error.
An order is expressed either by ``quantity`` (units, fractional allowed) OR ``cash_qty``
(amount in the quote currency) — never both at the same time.

Buy-by-value (``cash_qty``) is a MARKET-BUY-only mode on both venues (IBKR cashQty;
crypto ``createMarketBuyOrderWithCost``); to sell/close you must use a fractional
``quantity``. That is why ``quantity`` is ``Decimal``, not ``int``.
