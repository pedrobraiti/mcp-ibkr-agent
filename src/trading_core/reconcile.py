"""Reconcile dispatched-but-unconfirmed orders against the venue's live orders.

After a timeout/crash an order may have landed without its outcome being journaled, so the
idempotency guard blocks an identical resend (fail-safe). This is how that block is cleared:
match each unresolved intent's ``client_order_id`` (cOID) to a live order on the venue and
mark it resolved. An order that is NOT found among the open orders is left blocked by default
(it may have filled and closed — resending blind would double it); the operator can accept the
risk explicitly with ``resolve_missing=True`` after verifying fills/positions.
