"""Safety locks over order execution.

``GuardedBroker`` is a decorator over ``BrokerPort``: it applies the hard rules BEFORE
delegating to the real broker. Rules:
  1. Live only with ``allow_live=True`` (otherwise blocked).
  2. A BUY's notional must not exceed ``max_order_value`` (exits aren't value-capped).
  3. Cumulative daily spend must not exceed ``max_daily_value`` (if set).
  4. An identical order within ``duplicate_window_seconds`` is rejected (idempotency).
  5. The market must be open (RTH), if required.
  6. ``dry_run`` (default): validates everything but does NOT send the order.

Every attempt (sent, dry-run, or blocked) is written to the ``TradeJournal`` when one
is provided.
